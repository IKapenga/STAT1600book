Historically throughout the United States college students watch about 35 hours a month of television with a standard deviation of 5 hours. Assume a random sample of 25 college students is taken in West Michigan.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the expected value of the sample mean.
  \item What is the Standard error of this estimate?
  \item What is the probability that the mean monthly hours spent watching tv for the college students is more than 36.5?
  \item What is the probability that the mean monthly hours spent watching tv is less than 34?
  \item What is the probability that the mean monthly hours watching tv is between 34.5 and 36?
  \item If an even larger sample of 250 students was taken and the SD remains the same, what is the new Standard Error of the estimate? Why did this occur?
\end{enumerate}
